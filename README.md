# View Component Gem 3.0 Slot Upgrader Script

Per [ViewComponent 3.0 Changelog](https://viewcomponent.org/CHANGELOG.html#v300): BREAKING: Remove deprecated slots setter methods. Use with_SLOT_NAME instead.

A Ruby script for the View Component Gem by Github that updates existing html.erb files that have slot calls inside of them to prepend the prefix "_with" due to the breaking change of slot calling.
